# Datathon Kit ⚡

A set of opinionated tools, code, and resources for quick and dirty Machine Learning projects, datathons, or ad-hoc competitions.

## 🚀 Workflow

When starting to address a new problem, follow these steps for a solid foundation.

1. Learn more about the problem.
   - Search for similar [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).
   - Check the task (classification, regression, ...) in [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/).
   - Check [Machine Learning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning) for similar problems.
2. Do a basic data exploration.
   - Understand the problem and gather a sense of what can be important.
   - Check outliers and missing values.
3. Get baseline model (e.g: return average of target) working end to end.
   - Keep track of the experiments and results.
4. Design an evaluation method as close as the final evaluation.
   - Plot local evaluation metrics against the public ones (correlation) to validate how well your validation strategy works.
5. Try different approaches for preprocessing (encodings, Deep Feature Synthesis, lags, aggregations, imputers, target/count encoding, sin/cos encoding, ...).
   - If you're working as a group, split preprocessing feature generation between files.
6. Apply any postprocessing that might fix small things.
   - Plot real and predicted target distribution to see how well your model understand the underlying distribution.
   - Heuristics (clipping, mapping to another distribution, ...) can be applied to improve or correct predictions.
7. Tune hyper-parameters once you've settled on an specific approach ([optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/)).
   - Plot learning curves (with [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/learning_curve.html) or [external tools](https://github.com/reiinakano/scikit-plot)) to avoid overfitting.
8. Plot and visualize the predictions (target vs predicted errors, histograms, random prediction, ...) to make sure they're doing as expected. Explain the predictions with [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).
9. If time allows, [build diverse models](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4/discussion/575784). [Stack](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_stack_predictors.html) models ([example](https://www.kaggle.com/couyang/featuretools-sklearn-pipeline#ML-Pipeline)) to improve performance. You can use [Hill Climbing](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4/discussion/575784) algorithms.
10. Iterate. Try to keep performance in mind so you can make the best use of your time.
